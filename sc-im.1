.SH NAME
sc-im \- A curses based, vim-like spreadsheet calculator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sc-im
.RI [ FILE ]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sc-im
Is a curses based spreadsheet calculator program with vim like key bindings.
.PP
SC-IM is a spreadsheet program based on SC

A spreadsheet is an interactive computer application program for organization
and analysis of data in tabular form. Spreadsheets are developed as computerized
simulations of paper accounting worksheets. The program operates on data
represented as cells of an array, organized in rows and columns. Each cell of
the array is a model–view–controller element that can contain either numeric or
text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a
value based on the contents of other cells.

The user of the spreadsheet can make changes in any stored value and observe the
effects on calculated values. This makes the spreadsheet useful for "what-if"
analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without tedious manual
recalculation. Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets,
and can display data either as text and numerals, or in graphical form. SC-IM
uses ncurses for visual interface and has vim-like keybindings and some
functional similarities with vim text editor.

.SH COLOR SUPPORT
Most terminals are able to display 256 colors these days. But some of them
enable only 16 colors by default. To enjoy
.BR sc-im "'s"
full capabilities, these terminals need to be signaled to enable 256 color
mode. This is usually done by setting the TERM environment variable.
