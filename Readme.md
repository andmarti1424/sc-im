## Installation

### Dependencies

* Requirements:

  - `ncurses` (best if compiled with wide chars support)
  - `bison` or `yacc`
  - `gcc`
  - `make`
  - `pkg-config` and `which` (for make to do its job)

* Optionals:

  - `tmux` / `xclip` / `pbpaste` (for clipboard copy/paste)
  - `gnuplot` (for plots)
  - `libxlsxreader` (for xls support)
  - `xlsxwriter` (for xlsx export support)
  - `libxml-2.0` and `libzip` (for xlsx/ods import support)
  - `lua` (for Lua scripting)
  - threads support (in case you want to test this in Minix, just disable autobackup and HAVE_PTHREAD)

### Manual

* Edit [`src/Makefile`](src/Makefile) according to your system and needs:
```
    vim src/Makefile
```

* Run `make`:
```
    make -C src
```

* Optional: You can install the binary `sc-im` in your system by typing with a privileged user:
```
    make -C src install
```

### Building on OS X

You can follow the instructions as above, but if you would like Lua scripting
support, you will need to install Lua 5.1, which you can do with,

```
    brew install lua@5.1
```

And then follow the instructions as above.

### Homebrew for OSX users

```
brew install sc-im
```

### Ubuntu with XLSX import & export

See [this wiki page](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/wiki/Ubuntu-with-XLSX-import-&-export).

### Configuration

The `scimrc` file can be used to configure `sc-im`. The file should be placed in the `~/.config/sc-im` directory.

Here is an example `~/.config/sc-im/scimrc` :

    set autocalc
    set numeric
    set numeric_decimal=0
    set overlap
    set xlsx_readformulas

Other configuration variables are listed in the [help file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andmarti1424/sc-im/freeze/src/doc).
