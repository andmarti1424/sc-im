Preparing v0.8.3
----------------
Here are the details of this release:

New stuff
---------
**Added Multi Sheet support
added :newsheet, :nextsheet, :prevsheet :delsheet COMMAND_MODE commands
`gt` and `gT` commands in NORMAL_MODE are now used for moving between sheets
added new colors types SHEET, CURRENT_SHEET and FILENM
.sc file saving with multiple sheets
loading xlsx with multiple sheet
saving xlsx with multiple sheets
add :renamesheet COMMAND_MODE command
created movetosheet command in gram.y, to be used internally or in scripts when saving

             reference cells from different sheets in formulas: ={"Sheet2"}!A2
Save triggers in files
** Added automated tests
C command in EDIT MODE

Changes:
--------
+ Adapt string and number search for multisheet
+ marks now considers sheet. We could have mark A in Sheet 1, and mark B on Sheet 2..
  modified tick() and fix_marks()
Renamed auto_justify to auto_fit
`gt` command of NORMAL_MODE renamed to `go`
Removed --sheet and --filename_with_mode configuration variables
UNDO now saves reference to the sheet where the action took place.
+ copy_to_undostruct() now keep in added/removed list struct ent_ptr *
  (that knows of sheets), rather than struct ent *.
Copy alignment of strings when doing `Pf`.
 undo: save maxrow, maxcol, modflg values before and after changes, so they can be restored after undo/redo actions
Modified yanklist to be struct ent_ptr list, rather thant struct ent list.
Ents_that_depends_on_list now takes ent_ptr rather than struct ent * as parameter
Backslash double quotes in cpaste. Issue 574.
Do not free ents of sheets when deleting a sheet manually (only at exit).  just mark them as deleted.
Inform old value and new value when changing configuration variable
UI optimizations
Store offscr_sc values when saving sc files. Restore them when loading sc files
Simplify clipboard code
xlsx.c: Convert to uppercase before replacing functions
Added D command on EDIT mode.
ESC in EDIT_MODE also confirm changes.
Reeval when pasting from clipboard and autocalc is set
Adjust Makefile to have logic for clipboard commands on MacOS


Fixes
-----
** fix in calc_mobile_cols()
** fix not updating graph correctly after yanking cells with references -> Pc -> undo.
   It could also segfault on ocassions as well. Added test5 and test6 for this.

Issue #568: handle '>' and '<' on mappings.
Issue #569: fix invalid read/write/segfault when deleting column.
            Added test8 and test9 for this.

fix horizontal scroll when editing cells with long strings (wider than screen)
Avoid reading passed maxcols maxrows when shifting left or up over last sheet column/row.
fix in Pv when pasting over same place where data was yanked.
fix in paste_yanked_ents: calloc didnt count that yanked cells could share dependencies.
fix a bug when refreshing grid when autowrap operates. Issue 578.
Avoid segfault in autobackup when no current file is set.
fix in cw dw c$ d$ commands of EDIT_MODE
fix leak in del_selected_cells
fix when using C-r in INSERT_MODE
fix arguments reversed on sc.colrow2a
fix in delete_filters that caused SEGFAULT. Issue 637.
fix in unformat. call to copy_to_undostruct with wrong parameters.


Pending to make v0.8.3 release
-------------------
Add is_deleted flag on sheets that are deleted. So ents have a chance to update its references to that sheet.
Then rebuild graph.



Ideas for v0.8.4
----------------
+ arv should have priority over scimrc.
+ rethink overlap. it shows incorrectly if text does not fit in the current LINE
+ user customizable UI header (bar)
+ modify search procedure. highlight matches
+ yank.c functions should receive yanklist pointer as parameter, rather than use yanklist global variable.
this could allow future use of registers to copy to and paste from.
+ registers for yanking
+ use yanklist for added/removed in undo?

Please open a discussion on GitHub to comment on these and other feature requests.

v0.8.2

Changes
-------

+ Improved yank and undo alloc'ing. Malloc as much we need from start in a long batch and avoid small mallocs.

+ Changed the way lua scripts are referenced in formulas. Now they are input as any other string formula,
    like this: \"@lua("script_name.lua", 1)
    being 1 if the reference should be added to the depgraph or not, making it evaluated just once or
    every time the depgraph is evaluated.
    NOTE that if set to 0 and the cell is referenced by another cell, it will be executed nonetheless.

+ Added new exec_lua configuration variable.

+ Rows now can have height higher than one LINE. See fj and fk in normal mode or :formatrow in command mode.

+ Wrap cell content. new autowrap config value. works when nooverlap and notruncate are set.

+ Open URL or file specified on cell (PR 401)

+ Import mkd files

+ Multiple frozen rows/columns (fr / fc in normal mode)

Added mapping_timeout configuration variable with a default value of 1500ms (used to be a fixed value of 800ms).
Added mouse support in insert and command mode. The selection of a cell gets copied to inputbar.
Added command_timeout configuration variable.
handle hidden rows/cols in undo/redo of ir/ic/dr/dc
Added backwards search with '?'
Restore \\* from old SC. \\{char} fills the cell with n occurrences of {char} to complete its width
Store frozen rows and cols when saving file
Added :formatcol command (handling its undo as well)
Added :formatrow command (handling its undo as well)
Added undo of freeze row and col
Handle \n in cell input, and with autowrap
Handle undoing changes in row height produced by string input

Changed input bar from window to pad: permits entering string longer than COLS.

@count counts cells with strings as well, and not just with numbers.

Handle entering a label after :datefmt for datetime value edition.

New dracula / papercolor themes.

Handle @mycol/@myrow calls during startup when no EvalJustOneVertex is yet called

Added @getent (FR issue #451)

+ The saving format for :w command would be according to current file format. #493
modified savefile() of file.c to check current file format before saving a file.
Keep consistent with other format such as csv and save the file with the same format as current file.

Added HELP_HIGHLIGHT definition color for help page.

Renamed GRID_PAIR to GRID_EVEN in color.c.

UNDO of :fsum is handled by let.

calc_offscr_rows/cols rewriten and renamed to calc_mobile_rows/cols

*CSV load/import time improvements (noticeable in large files).
*Fix error when ordering a range that had empty cells.
*Fix in csv import (isnumeric function).
*Fix when circular reference occurs:
 Before it put @ERR in expression.
 Now it preserves the var that makes the circular reference in the formula,
 but keeps the "ERROR" label in the ent.
 ERR errors propagate to other ents.
*Changes when an ent referenced by other ents is removed:
 Before, @ERR was set whereever the reference to a removed ent exists.
 Now, if an ent is removed because of:
    1. a dr dc sh sk command,
    is_deleted flag is set on those ents.
    eval return 0 for those cases, and CELLREF is put in e->op.
    2. 'x' command, flag is_deleted is not set.
    eval return 0 for those cases as well.
 REF and ERR errors propagate to other ENDS. 
 Another change: Now when deleting a cell, if they are referenced by others, vertex is not removed.
 (is_deleted ents shall always go to freeents to be reused..)
*Added check for not to copy duplicate ents in copy_to_undostruct.
*Removed split function.
