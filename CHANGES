Ideas for v0.8.6
----------------

+ Add is_deleted flag on sheets that are deleted. So ents have a chance to update its references to that sheet.
Then rebuild graph.
+ arv should have priority over scimrc.
+ rethink overlap. it shows incorrectly if text does not fit in the current LINE
+ user customizable UI header (bar)
+ modify search procedure. highlight matches
+ yank.c functions should receive yanklist pointer as parameter, rather than use yanklist global variable.
this could allow future use of registers to copy to and paste from.
+ registers for yanking
+ use yanklist for added/removed in undo?

v0.8.2

Changes
-------

+ Improved yank and undo alloc'ing. Malloc as much we need from start in a long batch and avoid small mallocs.

+ Changed the way lua scripts are referenced in formulas. Now they are input as any other string formula,
    like this: \"@lua("script_name.lua", 1)
    being 1 if the reference should be added to the depgraph or not, making it evaluated just once or
    every time the depgraph is evaluated.
    NOTE that if set to 0 and the cell is referenced by another cell, it will be executed nonetheless.

+ Added new exec_lua configuration variable.

+ Rows now can have height higher than one LINE. See fj and fk in normal mode or :formatrow in command mode.

Store frozen rows and cols when saving file
Added :formatcol command (handling its undo as well)
Added :formatrow command (handling its undo as well)
Added undo of freeze row and col

*Fix in csv import (isnumeric function).
*Fix when circular reference occurs:
 Before it put @ERR in expression.
 Now it preserves the var that makes the circular reference in the formula,
 but keeps the "ERROR" label in the ent.
 ERR errors propagate to other ents.
*Changes when an ent referenced by other ents is removed:
 Before, @ERR was set whereever the reference to a removed ent exists.
 Now, if an ent is removed because of:
    1. a dr dc sh sk command,
    is_deleted flag is set on those ents.
    eval return 0 for those cases, and CELLREF is put in e->op.
    2. 'x' command, flag is_deleted is not set.
    eval return 0 for those cases as well.
 REF and ERR errors propagate to other ENDS. 
 Another change: Now when deleting a cell, if they are referenced by others, vertex is not removed.
 (is_deleted ents shall always go to freeents to be reused..)
*Added check for not to copy duplicate ents in copy_to_undostruct.
*Removed split function.
